# This is a simple colour guessing game where the player clicks on a selected div of their choosing after considering a viable answer to the main header question.
# It has a randomised amount of colours ranging from 0, 0, 0 to 255, 255, 255. 
# Two different playing modes, Easy and Hard depending on how well the player knows rgb.
# The player can't lose, only from picking the correct colour last, if the player wins all divs will transition to the winning colour.

# Future iterations of this application will include a scoreboard and a 'Difficult' setting.
